 This user-guide will help you get started!
## Basic Functions
#### To use exos.fun aka exos, you must understand the basics, so here they are:
 1. Injection
 2. Execution
 3. Script Hub Usage
 4. Utility Usage
 5. Other miscellaneous things

## Executing a rbx.lua script
### To execute a script, click this button on the main page:
###### Note: you need to inject exos to be able to execute scripts.

## Using the Script Hub
###  To open the Script Hub, click this icon on the side-bar:

#### Script Hub is used to execute premade scripts, more scripts coming soon!
## Using the Utility Hub
###  To open the Utility Hub, click the 4th icon on the side-bar [to lazy to screenshot ik ok].
### The Utility Hub contains things such as a lua minifier witch helps you minify your scripts to make them harder to read (similar to a lua obfuscator)

## Miscellaneous things

 1. External UI
 2. Experiments

### What is an external UI?
#### If something breaks in the main UI of my exploit, you can open the external UI, that still allows you to exploit. (Although, it isnt as stylish or modern.)
### Go to the settings to open the external UI.
### Experiments (lib/experiments.exp)
#### This is used for me (minishxp) to test diffrent features without completely breaking exos. You can use it too!
###### Notice: to use experiments, please have a "exp." before each expcode that you put in the file.
#### List of experiments:

 1. null (No experiments enabled)
 2. no_rgb_mode (Default Experiment, disables Color Changing Borders)
 3. big.anti_skid (Everytime exos starts, puts a screenshot file into lib\cache-0.0.2.3\experiments\screencapture) 	[Broken]

# Thats it! I hope you have fun using exos!
###### it even has the word fun in its name, lol
